# Visualization of Syntgeny
This code is for visualization of [Syntgeny](https://github.com/BIONF/Syntgeny/tree/main), which detects the conservation of genes' order over a set of taxa.

# Before use
Before using it, we need to have two files, nodes.dmp and names.dmp, which we need to recover the full name of the species.
These files can be downloaded from this repository, or you can download the zip file [taxdump.tar.gz](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/) from this NCBI to get the newest version and put these two files into the same folder as the code files.

# Usage
Two parameters are needed, tsv file generated by Syntgeny and the output format.

Example command
```
python syntgeny_v.py test.syntgeny.tsv jpg
```
