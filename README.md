# Visualization of Syntgeny
This code is for visualization of [Syntgeny](https://github.com/BIONF/Syntgeny/tree/main), which detects the conservation of genes' order over a set of taxa.

# Before use
Before using it, we need to have two files, `nodes.dmp` and `names.dmp`, which are used to recover the full name of the species.
These files can be downloaded from NCBI, just click [here](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/) to get the zip file `taxdump.tar.gz` and put the two files we need into the same folder as the code file.

Additionally, the packages we need are listed in `requirements.txt`, they can be installed using the following command.  
ps. Maybe you already have `kaleido`, but with the most recent version you can't run the code successfully, it is recommended to use an older version.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
Two parameters are needed, `tsv file` generated by Syntgeny and the output `format`.
Supported format parameters include html, png, jpg, jpeg, webp, svg, pdf.
The default format is html, when you don't enter any format.

Example command
```
python syntgeny_v.py test.syntgeny.tsv jpg
```
